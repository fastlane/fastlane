## I want to help work on _fastlane_ by reviewing issues and PRs

Thanks! We would really appreciate the help! Feel free to read our document on how to [respond to issues and PRs][responding to prs] and also check out how to become a [core contributor][core contributor].

## Why did my issue/PR get closed?

It's not you, it's us! _fastlane_ and its related tools receive a lot of issues and PRs. In order to effectively work through them and give each the prompt attention it deserves, we need to keep a sharp focus on the work we have outstanding.

One way we do this is by closing issues that we don't feel are immediately actionable. This might mean that we need more information in order to investigate. Or, it might mean that we haven't been able to reproduce it using the provided info. In this case we might close the issue while we wait for others to reproduce the problem and possibly provide some more info that unlocks the mystery.

<a id="fastlane-bot"/>

Another way we do this is by having an [automated bot](https://github.com/fastlane/issue-bot) go through our issues and PRs. The main goal of the bot is to ensure that the issues are still relevant and reproducible. Issues can be opened, and later fall idle for a variety of reasons:

* The user later decided not to use _fastlane_
* A workaround was found, making it a low priority for the user
* The user changed projects and/or companies
* A new version of _fastlane_ has been released that fixed the problem

No matter the reason, the _fastlane_ bot will ask for confirmation that an issue is still relevant after two months of inactivity. If the ticket becomes active again, it will remain open. If another 10 days pass with no activity, however, the ticket will be automatically closed.

In any case, **a closed issue is not necessarily the end of the story!** If more info becomes available after an issue is closed, it can be reopened for further consideration.

One of the best ways we can keep _fastlane_ an approachable, stable, and dependable tool is to be deliberate about how we choose to modify it. If we don't adopt your changes or new feature into _fastlane,_ that doesn't mean it was bad work! It may be that the _fastlane_ philosophy about how to accomplish a particular task doesn't align well with your approach. The best way to make sure that your time is well spent in contributing to _fastlane_ is to **start your work** on a modification or new feature **by opening an issue to discuss the problem or shortcoming with the community**. The _fastlane_ maintainers will do our best to give early feedback about whether a particular goal and approach is likely to be something we want to adopt!
