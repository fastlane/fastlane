# fastlane actions

This page contains a list of all built-in fastlane actions and their available options.

To get the most up-to-date information from the command line on your current version you can also run

```sh
fastlane actions # list all available fastlane actions
fastlane action [action_name] # more information for a specific action
```

You can import another `Fastfile` by using the `import` action. This is useful if you have shared lanes across multiple apps and you want to store a `Fastfile` in a separate folder. The path must be relative to the `Fastfile` this is called from.

```ruby
import './path/to/other/Fastfile'
```

For _fastlane_ plugins, check out the [available plugins](https://docs.fastlane.tools/plugins/available-plugins) page.
