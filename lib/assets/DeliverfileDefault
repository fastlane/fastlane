# Dynamic generation of the ipa file
# I'm using Shenzhen by Mattt, but you can use any build tool you want
# Remove the whole block if you do not want to upload an ipa file
ipa do
    # Add any code you want, like incrementing the build 
    # number or changing the app identifier

    # Attention: When you return a valid ipa file, this file will get uploaded and released
    # If you only want to upload app metadata, remove the complete ipa block.

    # system("ipa build --verbose") # build your project using Shenzhen
    "./[[APP_NAME]].ipa" # Tell 'Deliver' where it can find the finished ipa file
end

# ipa "./latest.ipa" # this can be used instead of the `do` block, if you prefer manually building the ipa file

# beta_ipa do
    # system("ipa build --verbose") # customize this to build beta version
    # "./ad_hoc_build.ipa" # upload ipa file using `deliver --beta`
